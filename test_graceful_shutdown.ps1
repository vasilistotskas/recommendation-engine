Write-Host "Manual Test Instructions:"
Write-Host "========================================"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "To test graceful shutdown behavior:"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "1. In one terminal, monitor the readiness endpoint:"
Write-Host "   while (\$true) { " -NoNewline
Write-Host "curl http://localhost:8080/ready" -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "; Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 }"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "2. In another terminal, send SIGTERM to the API:"
Write-Host "   " -NoNewline
Write-Host "Ctrl+C" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   (or find the process and kill it)"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "3. Expected behavior:"
Write-Host "   - Readiness immediately returns 503 'unavailable'"
Write-Host "   - Server waits 30 seconds for in-flight requests"
Write-Host "   - Then server shuts down completely"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "4. Kubernetes behavior:"
Write-Host "   - K8s removes pod from service load balancer"
Write-Host "   - No new traffic is routed to this pod"
Write-Host "   - Existing requests have 30s to complete"
Write-Host "   - Zero-downtime deployment achieved! ✨"
