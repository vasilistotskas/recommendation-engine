# Integration Tests - Task 32.1 Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the end-to-end integration tests implemented for the Recommendation Engine as part of Task 32.1.

## Test Coverage

The integration tests validate the complete workflow from entity creation to recommendation generation, covering:

### 1. Complete Workflow Test (`test_complete_workflow_from_entity_creation_to_recommendations`)

**Purpose**: Validates the entire recommendation pipeline from start to finish.

**Test Steps**:
1. **Entity Creation**: Creates 3 products with different attributes (electronics and sports categories)
2. **Interaction Recording**: Records user interactions (views, add-to-cart) with products
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Requests recommendations based on user behavior patterns
4. **Content-Based Filtering**: Requests similar products based on entity attributes
5. **Hybrid Recommendations**: Requests recommendations combining both algorithms

**Validations**:
- Entities are created successfully with correct IDs and types
- Interactions are recorded with appropriate weights (AddToCart > View)
- All three algorithms return valid recommendations or indicate cold start
- Recommendations are properly formatted with scores and metadata

### 2. Multi-Tenancy Isolation Test (`test_multi_tenancy_isolation`)

**Purpose**: Ensures complete data isolation between different tenants.

**Test Steps**:
1. **Tenant A Setup**: Creates entities and interactions for tenant A
2. **Tenant B Setup**: Creates entities and interactions for tenant B
3. **Cross-Tenant Access**: Attempts to access tenant B's data from tenant A context
4. **Recommendation Isolation**: Verifies recommendations don't leak across tenants

**Validations**:
- Tenant A cannot see tenant B's entities (returns None)
- Tenant B cannot see tenant A's entities (returns None)
- Each tenant can access their own entities
- Recommendations for tenant A don't include tenant B's products
- Tenant context is properly enforced at all layers

### 3. All Algorithms Test (`test_all_algorithms`)

**Purpose**: Validates all recommendation algorithms with realistic data.

**Test Steps**:
1. **Data Setup**: Creates 10 products across 2 categories (electronics, sports)
2. **User Interactions**: Creates 5 users with varying interaction patterns
3. **Collaborative Test**: Requests user-based recommendations
4. **Content-Based Test**: Requests entity similarity recommendations
5. **Hybrid Test**: Requests combined algorithm recommendations

**Validations**:
- All algorithms return results or indicate cold start appropriately
- Scores are in valid range [0.0, 1.0]
- Content-based recommendations prefer same-category items
- Hybrid algorithm combines both approaches
- Recommendations are sorted by score in descending order

## Test Architecture

### Test System Setup

The tests use a `TestSystem` struct that initializes:
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- Redis cache for hot data
- All service layers (Entity, Interaction, Recommendation)
- All recommendation engines (Collaborative, Content-Based, Hybrid)

### Test Data Cleanup

Each test:
1. Cleans up data **before** running (ensures clean state)
2. Runs the test with isolated tenant IDs
3. Cleans up data **after** completion (prevents pollution)

Tenant IDs used:
- `test_tenant_workflow` - Complete workflow test
- `tenant_a_isolation` / `tenant_b_isolation` - Multi-tenancy test
- `test_tenant_algorithms` - All algorithms test

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **PostgreSQL 14+** with pgvector extension
2. **Redis 7+**
3. **Rust 1.90+**

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Create test database
createdb recommendations_test

# 2. Install pgvector extension
psql -d recommendations_test -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"

# 3. Start Redis (if not running)
redis-server

# 4. Set environment variables (optional)
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/recommendations_test"
export TEST_REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/1"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
cargo test -p recommendation-integration-tests

# Run with output
cargo test -p recommendation-integration-tests -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test -p recommendation-integration-tests test_complete_workflow_from_entity_creation_to_recommendations

# Run tests sequentially (recommended for integration tests)
cargo test -p recommendation-integration-tests -- --test-threads=1
```

### Expected Output

```
running 3 tests
test test_all_algorithms ... ok
test test_complete_workflow_from_entity_creation_to_recommendations ... ok
test test_multi_tenancy_isolation ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Test Requirements Mapping

These tests satisfy **Requirement 13.2** from the requirements document:

> THE Recommendation Engine SHALL include integration tests validating all API endpoints with realistic data

### Coverage:

- ✅ **Entity Management** (Requirement 1): Create, update, delete operations
- ✅ **Interaction Tracking** (Requirement 2): Record interactions with deduplication
- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering** (Requirement 3): User-based recommendations
- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** (Requirement 4): Entity similarity recommendations
- ✅ **Hybrid Recommendations** (Requirement 5): Combined algorithm approach
- ✅ **Multi-Tenancy** (Requirement 21): Complete data isolation between tenants
- ✅ **Cold Start Handling** (Requirement 12): Fallback for new users/entities

## Test Data

### Entities Created

**Complete Workflow Test**:
- 3 products (2 electronics, 1 sports)
- Attributes: name, category, price, brand

**Multi-Tenancy Test**:
- 2 products (1 per tenant)
- Attributes: name, category

**All Algorithms Test**:
- 10 products (5 electronics, 5 sports)
- Attributes: name, category, price, rating

### Interactions Created

**Complete Workflow Test**:
- 1 user with 3 interactions (2 views, 1 add-to-cart)

**Multi-Tenancy Test**:
- 2 users (1 per tenant) with 1 view each

**All Algorithms Test**:
- 5 users with 3 interactions each (15 total)

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Errors

```
Error: Failed to create database pool after 3 retries
Caused by: password authentication failed for user "..."
```

**Solution**: Update `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable with correct credentials:
```bash
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/recommendations_test"
```

### pgvector Extension Missing

```
Error: extension "vector" does not exist
```

**Solution**: Install pgvector extension:
```bash
psql -d recommendations_test -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

### Redis Connection Errors

```
Error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

**Solution**: Start Redis server:
```bash
redis-server
# Or on Windows:
redis-server.exe
```

### Test Failures Due to Leftover Data

**Solution**: Manually clean test database:
```bash
psql -d recommendations_test -c "TRUNCATE entities, interactions, user_profiles, trending_entities CASCADE;"
```
