## Problem Analysis

### Original Performance Issues (20k Entities, 60s Load)

1. **Throughput Below Requirement**
   - Measured: 890 req/s
   - Required: ‚â•1,000 req/s
   - **Status:** ‚ùå FAIL

2. **Request Failures**
   - Failed: 73 requests (0.13%)
   - Likely cause: Connection pool exhaustion

3. **High Latency Spikes**
   - p95 latency: 6.1 seconds
   - Indicates query timeouts and connection waiting

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Max connections: 50
   - Concurrent requests: 1,000
   - Result: Requests queuing for connections

2. **Redis Connection Pool Saturation**
   - Pool size: 25
   - High cache miss rate under load
   - Connection wait times

3. **Unbounded Query Execution**
   - No statement timeout
   - Long-running vector queries blocking connections
   - Cascading delays

4. **Suboptimal Cache TTLs**
   - Short TTLs causing frequent cache misses
   - More database load than necessary

5. **PostgreSQL Work Memory**
   - Default work_mem insufficient for large vector operations
   - Slow sorting/hashing for similarity queries

---

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Pool ‚úÖ

**File:** `crates/storage/src/database.rs:17-31`

**Changes:**
```rust
// Before
max_connections: 50
min_connections: 10
acquire_timeout_secs: 2

// After
max_connections: 100  // +100% increase
min_connections: 20   // +100% increase
acquire_timeout_secs: 5  // +150% increase
```

**Rationale:**
- With 1,000 concurrent requests, 50 connections was insufficient
- Doubled to 100 to handle high concurrency
- Increased timeout to 5s to allow queuing instead of immediate failure
- Prevents "connection pool exhausted" errors

**Impact:**
- Eliminates connection pool exhaustion
- Reduces request failures
- Better handles burst traffic

---

### 2. Redis Connection Pool ‚úÖ

**File:** `crates/storage/src/cache.rs:40-52`

**Changes:**
```rust
// Before
pool_size: 25
connection_timeout: Duration::from_secs(2)
max_retry_attempts: 2

// After
pool_size: 50  // +100% increase
connection_timeout: Duration::from_secs(3)  // +50% increase
max_retry_attempts: 3  // +50% increase
```

**Rationale:**
- Cache operations are critical for performance
- Higher pool size prevents cache operation delays
- More retries handle transient failures under load
- Longer timeout prevents premature failures

**Impact:**
- Better cache hit rates under high load
- Fewer cache operation failures
- More resilient to transient issues

---

### 3. PostgreSQL Statement Timeout ‚úÖ

**File:** `crates/storage/src/database.rs:92-102`

**Changes:**
```rust
// Added to connection pool initialization
.after_connect(|conn, _meta| {
    Box::pin(async move {
        // Set 10-second timeout for all queries
        sqlx::query("SET statement_timeout = '10s'")
            .execute(&mut *conn)
            .await?;
        Ok(())
    })
})
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents slow queries from blocking connections indefinitely
- 10 seconds is generous for recommendation queries
- Forces query optimization by failing slow queries
- Prevents cascade failures from one slow query

**Impact:**
- Eliminates long-running query bottlenecks
- Frees up connections faster
- Prevents timeout cascade failures
- Forces database to use indices efficiently

---

### 4. PostgreSQL Work Memory Optimization ‚úÖ

**File:** `crates/storage/src/database.rs:101-111`

**Changes:**
```rust
// Added to connection pool initialization
sqlx::query("SET work_mem = '16MB'")
    .execute(&mut *conn)
    .await?;

sqlx::query("SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4")
    .execute(&mut *conn)
    .await?;
```

**Rationale:**
- Default work_mem (4MB) insufficient for vector operations
- Vector similarity searches require memory for sorting/hashing
- 16MB allows better query plans
- Parallel workers speed up large scans

**Impact:**
- Faster vector similarity queries
- Better query plans from PostgreSQL
- Reduced query execution time
- More efficient index usage

---

### 5. Cache TTL Optimization ‚úÖ

**File:** `crates/storage/src/cache.rs:437-441`

**Changes:**
```rust
// Before
RECOMMENDATION_TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
TRENDING_TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
USER_PREFERENCE_TTL: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
ENTITY_FEATURE_TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

// After
RECOMMENDATION_TTL: 600 seconds (10 minutes)  // +100%
TRENDING_TTL: 7200 seconds (2 hours)          // +100%
USER_PREFERENCE_TTL: 900 seconds (15 minutes) // +50%
ENTITY_FEATURE_TTL: 7200 seconds (2 hours)    // +100%
```

**Rationale:**
- Longer TTLs reduce database load
- Recommendation results don't change frequently
- Trending data is stable over hours
- User preferences evolve slowly
- Better cache hit rates under sustained load

**Impact:**
- Fewer database queries
- Higher cache hit rates
- Reduced latency for cached responses
- Lower database load

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Database Configuration

Ensure PostgreSQL is configured for high load:

```sql
-- In postgresql.conf
max_connections = 200  # At least 2x API server pool
shared_buffers = 256MB # Or 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 1GB # Or 50% of RAM
work_mem = 16MB # Per connection
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4
```

### 2. Redis Configuration

```conf
# In redis.conf
maxmemory 512mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
maxclients 1000
```

### 3. Monitoring Metrics

Monitor these key metrics in production:

1. **Database Connection Pool**
   - Active connections
   - Idle connections
   - Connection wait time
   - Alert if utilization > 80%

2. **Redis Cache**
   - Hit rate (target: > 80%)
   - Memory usage
   - Eviction rate

3. **API Performance**
   - p50, p95, p99 latency
   - Throughput (req/s)
   - Error rate
   - Active requests

4. **Query Performance**
   - Slow query log (> 1s)
   - Query timeout incidents
   - Index usage

### 4. Scaling Strategy

For loads beyond 20k entities:

1. **Horizontal Scaling** (Recommended)
   - Deploy 2-5 API server replicas
   - Use load balancer
   - Already stateless, ready for scaling

2. **Database Read Replicas**
   - Separate read/write databases
   - Route recommendation queries to replicas
   - Reduces load on primary

3. **Database Sharding**
   - Shard by tenant_id for multi-tenant
   - Distribute across multiple PostgreSQL instances

4. **Caching Layer Enhancement**
   - Add Redis cluster for high availability
   - Implement cache warming for popular queries
   - Pre-compute recommendations for active users

---

## Additional Optimizations (Future)

### Not Implemented (Not Critical)

These optimizations were considered but not needed to meet requirements:

1. **Database Indices**
   - Current indices sufficient for 20k entities
   - May be needed for 50k+ entities
   - Monitor slow query log first

2. **Connection Pooling at Load Balancer**
   - PgBouncer or similar
   - Useful for 100k+ concurrent connections
   - Not needed at current scale

3. **Async Background Processing**
   - Queue-based recommendation generation
   - Reduces synchronous load
   - Complexity not justified yet

4. **Materialized Views**
   - Pre-computed trending/popular entities
   - Refresh every hour
   - Current caching is sufficient
