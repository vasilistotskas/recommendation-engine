## Implementation Date
October 20, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 11.1 InteractionService Struct ✅
**File**: `crates/service/src/interaction.rs`

**Key Features**:
- Service struct with vector store dependency
- Configurable interaction weights (view=1.0, add_to_cart=3.0, purchase=5.0, like=2.0)
- Support for custom interaction types with custom weights
- Comprehensive input validation for user_id and entity_id

**Methods**:
- `new()` - Create service with default interaction weights
- `with_weights()` - Create service with custom interaction weights
- `get_interaction_weight()` - Get weight for any interaction type
- `validate_user_id()` - Validate user_id format and constraints
- `validate_entity_id()` - Validate entity_id format and constraints

**Validation Rules**:
- IDs cannot be empty
- IDs cannot exceed 255 characters
- IDs cannot contain null characters

### 11.2 User Profile Updates ✅
**Implementation**: Asynchronous profile updates triggered by interactions

**Key Features**:
- Automatic profile update within 5 seconds of interaction (using tokio::spawn)
- Fire-and-forget async pattern to avoid blocking interaction recording
- Computes preference vector from weighted entity feature vectors
- Updates interaction count and last interaction timestamp
- Graceful error handling with logging

**Helper Function**:
- `update_user_profile_async()` - Async function that:
  - Computes preference vector from user interactions
  - Gets interaction count
  - Gets last interaction timestamp
  - Upserts user profile in database

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Update user preference vector asynchronously (Req 2.3)
- ✅ Trigger update within 5 seconds of interaction (Req 2.3)

### 11.3 Interaction History Queries ✅
**Implementation**: Multiple query methods with filtering and pagination

**Methods Implemented**:

1. **`get_user_interactions()`**
   - Basic pagination with limit and offset
   - Returns interactions ordered by timestamp DESC
   - Validates user_id before querying

2. **`get_user_interactions_by_type()`**
   - Filters interactions by interaction type
   - Supports all interaction types (View, AddToCart, Purchase, Like, Rating, Custom)
   - Uses helper function `matches_interaction_type()` for type matching
   - Includes pagination

3. **`get_user_interactions_by_date_range()`**
   - Filters interactions by start and end date
   - Validates that start_date is before end_date
   - Returns interactions within the specified time window
   - Includes pagination

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Implement get_user_interactions with pagination (Req 2.1)
- ✅ Support filtering by interaction_type (Req 2.1)
- ✅ Support filtering by date range (Req 2.1)

### 11.4 Bulk Interaction Import ✅
**Implementation**: High-performance batch processing with error reporting

**Method**: `bulk_import_interactions()`

**Key Features**:
- Processes interactions in batches of 1000 for optimal performance
- Validates each interaction before import
- Applies configurable interaction weights
- Supports optional timestamps (defaults to current time)
- Comprehensive error reporting with per-record details
- Returns detailed BulkImportResult with job tracking

**Batch Processing**:
- Validates user_id and entity_id for each interaction
- Computes interaction weights based on type
- Uses vector_store.bulk_import_interactions() for efficient database insertion
- Handles partial failures gracefully

**Result Structure**:
```rust
BulkImportResult {
    job_id: String,              // Unique job identifier
    status: ImportStatus,        // Completed/PartiallyCompleted/Failed
    total_records: usize,        // Total interactions to import
    processed: usize,            // Number processed
    successful: usize,           // Number successfully imported
    failed: usize,               // Number failed
    errors: Vec<BulkImportError> // Detailed error information
}
```

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Add bulk interaction import endpoint (Req 24.2)
- ✅ Process interactions in batches (Req 24.2)
- ✅ Validate and report errors (Req 24.5)

## Core Functionality

### Interaction Recording with Deduplication
**Method**: `record_interaction()`

**Features**:
- Records user-entity interactions with metadata
- Applies configurable weights based on interaction type
- Deduplication handled at storage layer (60-second window)
- Triggers async user profile update
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

**Parameters**:
- `ctx: &TenantContext` - Multi-tenant isolation
- `user_id: String` - User identifier
- `entity_id: String` - Entity identifier
- `entity_type: String` - Entity type for proper categorization
- `interaction_type: InteractionType` - Type of interaction
- `metadata: Option<HashMap<String, String>>` - Optional metadata
- `timestamp: Option<DateTime<Utc>>` - Optional timestamp (defaults to now)

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Record interaction with deduplication (Req 2.1, 2.5)
- ✅ Apply configurable interaction weights (Req 2.2)
- ✅ Store interaction within 50ms (delegated to storage layer)

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- **VectorStore**: All database operations for interactions and user profiles
- **TenantContext**: Multi-tenant data isolation
- **InteractionType**: Enum for different interaction types
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for background profile updates

### Storage Layer Integration
The service delegates to VectorStore methods:
- `record_interaction()` - Store interaction with deduplication
- `get_user_interactions()` - Query interaction history
- `bulk_import_interactions()` - Batch insert interactions
- `compute_user_preference_vector()` - Compute preference from interactions
- `get_user_interaction_count()` - Get total interaction count
- `upsert_user_profile()` - Create or update user profile
